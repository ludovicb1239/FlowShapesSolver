# FlowFree Shapes Solver

Welcome to **FlowFree Shapes Solver**! üéâ This open-source C# project harnesses the power of OpenCV to automatically scan puzzles, detect their layout, and move the cursor to solve them with unmatched speed and precision. Whether you're facing a simple challenge or a complex puzzle, Flow Shapes Solver is here to help.

## üöÄ Features

- **Accurate Puzzle Scanning**: Utilizes OpenCV to detect and interpret puzzle elements from any screen.
- **Mouse Automation**: Automatically moves the cursor to execute the solution seamlessly.
- **Versatile Puzzle Support**: Designed to work with a variety of puzzle types and layouts.
- **Optimized for Windows**: Developed in C# for a smooth Windows experience.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Continuously monitors the puzzle state to ensure the solution is correctly applied.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute under the MIT License.

   - Build the solution to compile the executable.
4. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the program and start solving any puzzle in record time!

## üß© How It Works

1. **Puzzle Scanning**:The program uses OpenCV to scan the screen and identify the puzzle‚Äôs structure, ensuring every element is accurately detected.
2. **Solving Algorithm**:An efficient algorithm processes the scanned data to determine the optimal solution path.
3. **Mouse Control**:Once the solution is determined, the program automates mouse movements to draw the solution directly on-screen.
